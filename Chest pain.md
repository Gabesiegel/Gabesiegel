## Rapid Access

*   [Approach to the Critical Patient] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
*   [Diagnostic approach to chest pain] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recnCskZ7cdQzjZES/Approach-to-Chest-Pain)

## AIRWAY

*   Allow patients to assume a position of comfort if possible.
*   Administer oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation (SaO2) >92%.
*   Prepare for intubation.
    *   Patients with obstructive shock may become more unstable with intubation. Treatment of underlying cause (massive pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, or cardiac tamponade) should be considered first when possible.
    *   Preparation includes
        *   Optimizing volume status
        *   Strongly consider initiating vasopressors prior to intubation if the patient is hypotensive or has a shock index < 0.7
        *   Having [push-dose pressors] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recJCKsNuvUC7XNDn/Bedside-Epinephrine-Drip-Dirty-Epi-Drip) ready:
            *   Phenylephrine 50-200 μg intravenous, over 20-30 seconds every 2-5 minutes (no maximum dose)
            *   Epinephrine 5-20 μg intravenous, may repeat every 2 minutes

## BREATHING

*   Give supplemental oxygen if the patient is hypoxemic.
*   [Non-invasive ventilation (bilevel or continuous positive airway pressure] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recnCskZ7cdQzjZES/Approach-to-Chest-Pain) plays an important role in congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   Cautions:
    *   Use non-invasive ventilation with caution and only under direct supervision if a patient is at risk of aspiration.
    *   If a patient has a tension pneumothorax, decompression is indicated before positive pressure ventilation.

## CIRCULATION

*   Place the patient on a cardiac monitor.
*   Intravenous access: Send blood samples to the lab.
*   Obtain an ECG.
*   Consider early use of point-of-care ultrasound for patients presenting with hypotension.
*   In acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a patient may become hypotensive. Hypotension may be due to an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) causing decreased stroke volume, an inferior MI with reduced preload, or significant bradycardia.
    *   Anterior MI may require vasopressors.
    *   Inferior MI responds to intravenous fluids or atropine in bradycardia.
*   Beware of administering nitrates to patients who are hypotensive, bradycardic, or tachycardic.
*   Nitrates may cause marked hypotension if patients have used phosphodiesterase inhibitors within the past 24 - 48 hours. Be certain to ask if the patient has used any of these medications (e.g., sildenafil or tadalafil) recently, and if so, avoid using nitrates.
*   In hypotensive patients with massive pulmonary embolism or cardiogenic shock from MI, consider norepinephrine for vasopressor support.
    *   Norepinephrine: start at 0.1 μg/kg/minute and titrate for effect
*   In acute aortic dissection, limit the extension of dissection by decreasing shear forces using negative chronotropic then antihypertensive agents.
    *   Goal heart rate: 60-80
    *   Goal systolic blood pressure: <120 mm Hg

## DISABILITY

*   Perform a quick neurological examination.
*   An abnormal neurologic exam may be due to a stroke or infarction of the spinal cord from a type A aortic dissection.

## EXPOSURE

*   Remove clothes and place the patient in a gown to allow for a full examination.
*   Exam findings, such as sternotomy scars, diaphoresis, and signs of hypoperfusion can be missed if the patient is not properly exposed.

## Key Concepts

*   Patients with a wide range of pathology present to the ED with chest pain. Some diagnoses are critical, some are urgent, and most are benign. [Lindsell CJ, Anantharaman V, Diercks D, et al. The Internet Tracking Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes (i*trACS): a multicenter registry of patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndromes reported using the standardized reporting guidelines for emergency department chest pain studies. Ann Emerg Med. 2006;48(6):666-677.e6779. doi:10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.08.005]
* It is the role of the emergency provider to evaluate chest pain with a view to ruling out any life-threatening diagnoses, addressing acute needs, assessing the need for hospitalization, and referring low-risk patients for outpatient follow-up as appropriate.
*   For patients in shock, start acute resuscitation. Point-of-care ultrasound may be useful to determine etiology.
*   Patients with acute or stable chest pain not thought to be caused by ACS and deemed to be low risk for an urgent cause or adverse effects do not need urgent diagnostic testing for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Attempt to identify patients most likely to benefit from further testing (ie, intermediate or high pretest risk of obstructive coronary disease).
*   For many patients, initial orders include acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg chewed), chest radiograph, ECG, serum troponin and basic labs while a differential diagnosis is worked through.
*   A patient with an initially inconclusive chest pain work-up should be evaluated for ACS. Use structured risk assessment estimates with evidence-based and institutionally agreed-upon diagnostic protocols.

## Diagnosis

### Textbook presentations

*   A 64-year-old with a history of uncontrolled hypertension presents in distress with an abrupt onset of severe, tearing chest pain that radiates to the upper back between the scapulae. They are markedly diaphoretic and a pulse deficit is noted in the left upper extremity. (Thoracic aortic dissection)
*   A 50-year-old man with a history of alcohol use disorder presents with severe chest pain that started immediately after vomiting. On examination, crepitus can be palpated over his chest wall and around his neck. (Esophageal rupture)
*   A 32-year-old woman presents with chest pain, shortness of breath and lightheadedness that began shortly after she landed after an overseas flight. The pain varies with respiration and is much worse when she breathes deeply. She is a smoker and also takes a daily oral contraceptive pill. On exam, she is hypoxic and hypotensive. (Submassive pulmonary embolism)
*   A 23-year-old woman presents with intermittent sharp, stabbing pain in her anterior chest. It is worse when she lifts her arms, and better when she is still. There is no associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea. She is athletic and able to rapidly ascend multiple flights of stairs without difficulty. On exam, she is exquisitely tender over the sterno-calvaocular joints along both sides of the sternum. (Musculoskeletal pain, costochondritis or Tietze syndrome)

## History

### History of present illness

*   The mnemonic “OLDCAAAR” can assist with eliciting descriptors of the patient’s chest pain; it stands for: onset, location, duration, character, alleviating/aggravating factors, associated symptoms, activity at onset, and radiation. [Mattu A. Evaluation of chest pain and diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. In Weinstock MB, Longstreth R, eds. Bouncebacks! Emergency Department Cases: ED Returns. Columbus, Ohio, Anadem Publishing, 2018, pp 96-104]
*   Ask about the onset of pain
    *   A sudden onset of chest pain should raise concern for thoracic aortic dissection, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism.
*   Ask about the location of pain
    *   Back pain, particularly midscapular pain, suggests aortic dissection but is also consistent with ACS.
    *   Substernal pain, jaw pain, neck pain, epigastric pain, or isolated back pain, all may occur with ACS.
*   Ask about the duration of pain
    *   Pain that only lasts for several seconds or, conversely, lasts continuously without waxing or waning for many hours or days is less likely to be related to ACS.
*   Ask the patient to characterize the pain
    *   The term chest discomfort is preferred when obtaining a history as patients may be reluctant to use the word “pain.”
    *   The pain of myocardial ischemia is a deep visceral discomfort that is difficult to localize and usually diffuse.
    *   Probability of ischemic based on common patient descriptors
        *   Sharp or stabbing pain is consistent with thoracic aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, mediastinitis after esophageal rupture, but less likely to be due to ACS. [Writing Committee Members, Gulati M, Levy PD, et al. 2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines. J Cardiovasc Comput Tomogr. 2022;16(1):54-122. doi:10.1016/j.jcct.2021.11.009]
        *   Severe sharp (68%), ripping (50%) or tearing pain in the chest or back suggests thoracic aortic dissection.
*   Ask about alleviating or aggravating factors
    *   Symptoms that change with position may identify pericarditis or musculoskeletal chest pain, although the latter should be a diagnosis of exclusion.
    *   Pain that worsens with deep inspiration is more suggestive of pulmonary embolism or pericarditis.
    *   Exertional pain is highly concerning for ACS.
*   Ask about associated symptoms
    *   Associated dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness are non-specific.
    *   Esophageal rupture usually follows forceful vomiting, trauma, or a procedure such as endoscopy.
    *   Vomiting and diaphoresis in association with chest pain both increase the likelihood for ACS.
*   Ask about any radiation of the pain
    *   Pain radiating to the back should raise concern for thoracic aortic dissection.
    *   Pain with ACS may radiate from/to the shoulders, jaw, neck, back or epigastrium.
    *   Classic teaching suggests that radiation to the left arm is highly specific for ACS; however, radiation to the right arm has a higher specificity for ACS, and bilateral radiation is the most concerning.

### Risk factors

#### Risk factors for acute coronary syndrome [Anderson JL, Adams CD, Antman EM, et al. 2011 ACCF/AHA Focused Update Incorporated Into the ACC/AHA 2007 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines [published correction appears in Circulation. 2011 Jun 7;123(22):e627]. Circulation. 2011;123(18):e426-e579. doi:10.1161/CIR.0b013e318212bb8b] [Mattu A, Petrini J, Swencki S, Chaudhari C, Brady WJ. Premature atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus. Am J Emerg Med. 2005;23(5):696-703. doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2004.12.012] [Long A, Long B, Koyfman A. Non-traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic disease: A review for emergency physicians. Am J Emerg Med. 2018;36(3):494-497. doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2017.12.036]

*   Advanced age
*   Known CAD
*   Hypertension
*   Hyperlipidemia
*   Diabetes mellitus
*   Vascular disease (eg, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack)
*   Family history of premature CAD
*   Cocaine/amphetamine use
*   Several other disease processes increase the risk of premature atherosclerotic disease and ACS, including human immunodeficiency virus, lupus (and other systemic inflammatory conditions), chronic cocaine use, chronic kidney disease, chronic alcoholism, and possibly some cancers and their therapies.
*   Many risk factors that heighten risk of ACS also increase the risk of alternative chest pain diagnoses.

### PEARLS

*   Classic risk factors are important in assessing chest pain. However, ED patients without these risk factors are not immune to having ACS. Conversely, while these risk factors increase lifetime risk of ACS, they are not known to increase risk of an acute event when clinical suspicion is otherwise low.

#### Risk factors for deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism

*   Stasis/immobilization (surgery)
*   Endothelial injury (trauma, infection)
*   Hypercoagulability (estrogen/postpartum, malignancy)
*   Most cases in the ED are idiopathic

#### Risk factors for aortic dissection

*   Hypertension (72%)
*   Atherosclerosis (30%)
*   Connective tissue disorder (5%) [Hagan PG, Nienaber CA, Isselbacher EM, et al. The International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD): new insights into an old disease. JAMA. 2000;283(7):897-903. doi:10.1001/jama.283.7.897] [Pape LA, Awais M, Woznicki EM, et al. Presentation, Diagnosis, and Outcomes of Acute Aortic Dissection: 17-Year Trends From the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2015;66(4):350-358. doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2015.05.029]

#### Risk factors for pericardial tamponade

*   Can present acutely from trauma or aortic injury vs. more slowly from cancer, infection, or other etiologies

#### Risk factors for tension pneumothorax

*   Often secondary to thoracic trauma
*   Alternatively, can be caused by a simple spontaneous pneumothorax progressing to tension pneumothorax
*   Smoking and connective tissue disorders are risk factors.

### Family and social history

*   First-degree relatives with a history of CAD diagnosed before the age of 55 (male) or 65 (female); pulmonary embolism or venous thromboembolism; or a history of aortic disease.
*   Smoking
*   Cocaine use can cause coronary vasospasm and lead to premature coronary atherosclerosis.
*   High levels of alcohol use are tied to increased atherosclerotic disease.

### PEARLS

*   The five historical factors most strongly associated with ACS include:
    *   Exertional discomfort
    *   Diaphoresis
    *   Radiation to the arms/neck/jaw
    *   Vomiting
    *   Similarity to past (proven) ischemia. [Body R, Carley S, Wibberley C, McDowell G, Ferguson J, Mackway-Jones K.

## Physical exam

### Vital signs

*   A complete set of vital signs should be obtained upon arrival to the ED, with abnormal vital signs requiring frequent rechecks.
*   Hypotension or shock should prompt immediate consideration of an obstructive cause requiring emergency intervention.
    *   Tension pneumothorax (finger or needle thoracostomy)
    *   Pericardial tamponade (pericardiocentesis)
    *   Pulmonary embolism (thrombolysis)
*   Hypoxemia is most consistent with tension pneumothorax, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism.
*   Tachycardia and tachypnea are rather non-specific; both are common in several life-threatening causes of chest pain.
*   Pulsus paradoxus, a systolic blood pressure drop > 10mmHg with inspiration (see video) occurs in pericardial tamponade. [Stein PD, Terrin ML, Hales CA, et al. Clinical, laboratory, roentgenographic, and electrocardiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism and no pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. Chest. 1991;100(3):598-603. doi:10.1378/chest.100.3.598 ]

### Cardiac exam

*   Auscultate the heart
    *   Diminished or muffled heart sounds or a pericardial rub may raise suspicion for pericarditis and/or pericardial tamponade.
    *   A diastolic murmur may be due to aortic regurgitation from a type A thoracic aortic dissection, endocarditis, or myopericardial syndromes.
    *   An S3 gallop is strongly associated with heart failure. [Wang CS, FitzGerald JM, Schulzer M, Mak E, Ayas NT. Does this dyspneic patient in the emergency department have congestive heart failure?. JAMA. 2005;294(15):1944-1956. doi:10.1001/jama.294.15.1944]

### Assess the extremities

*   A pulse deficit in one or more of the four extremities suggests an aortic dissection. This is observed in fewer than one-third of patients. [Pape LA, Awais M, Woznicki EM, et al. Presentation, Diagnosis, and Outcomes of Acute Aortic Dissection: 17-Year Trends From the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2015;66(4):350-358. doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2015.05.029]
* Asymmetric swelling is consistent with deep vein thrombosis, which occurs in 13% of patients with pulmonary embolism.  [Stein PD, Terrin ML, Hales CA, et al. Clinical, laboratory, roentgenographic, and electrocardiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism and no pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. Chest. 1991;100(3):598-603. doi:10.1378/chest.100.3.598]
*   Peripheral edema is consistent with heart failure.

### Examine the neck

*   [Jugular venous distention] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recnCskZ7cdQzjZES/Approach-to-Chest-Pain) may be seen with pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and heart failure.

### Pulmonary exam

*   Listen for breath sounds
    *   Absent breath sounds (and/or hyperresonance on percussion) may indicate tension pneumothorax.
    *   Wheezing is frequently present with pulmonary embolism (60% of cases) as well as reactive airway disease/COPD) and pneumonia.[Stein PD, Terrin ML, Hales CA, et al. Clinical, laboratory, roentgenographic, and electrocardiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism and no pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. Chest. 1991;100(3):598-603. doi:10.1378/chest.100.3.598]
    *   Wet crackles are most consistent with heart failure.

### Chest wall exam

*   Palpate the chest
    *   Subcutaneous emphysema should raise suspicion for esophageal perforation/rupture.
    *   Pain reproduced with palpation, especially if it is precisely localized, significantly decreases the likelihood of ACS, but does not eliminate it.
*   See chapter: [Chest Pain Evaluation for ACS](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)

### Abdominal exam

*   Palpate the abdomen
    *   The abdominal exam may reveal an alternate etiology (eg, biliary or pancreatic disease).
    *   Note that patients with epigastric pain, even epigastric tenderness of exam, may have an acute inferior MI.
    *   A pulsatile abdominal mass may indicate an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

### Skin exam

*   Check for signs of:
    *   herpes zoster (shingles)
    *   intravenous drug use (eg, track marks)
    *   trauma (eg, from altercation, intimate partner violence, non-accidental trauma)

### Neurologic exam

*   Perform a screening neurological exam.
*   Focal neurological deficits may be seen with thoracic aortic dissection, from either dissection or embolization into the cerebral vessels (stroke) or vascular supply to the spinal cord (infarction).

## DIfferential diagnosis

### Life-threatening causes of chest pain to consider

*   [Acute Coronary Syndromes] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec8tYnfjz2FpdGrE/Acute-Coronary-Syndromes)
*   [Aortic Dissection] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recN9AXGWMstEm8CO/Aortic-Dissection)
*   [Acute Myopericardial Syndromes] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recMrI1YMzIvGyWyF/Acute-Myopericardial-Syndromes)
*   [Esophageal Rupture] (https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNAvnIuiiea2rgr/Esophageal-Rupture)
*   Pericardial Tamponade
*   Pulmonary Embolism
*   Tension Pneumothorax

### Urgent differential diagnoses:

#### Cardiac Etiology

*   Heart Failure
*   Valvular disease
*   Inflammation of the heart: pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis

#### Pulmonary or Pleural Etiology

*   Pneumonia or other infection
*   Tracheitis
*   Pneumothorax
*   Exacerbation of asthma/COPD
*   Pleural effusion

#### Gastrointestinal Etiology

*   Biliary disease
*   Pancreatitis

### Common low-risk differential diagnoses

#### Cardiac Etiology

*   “Cardiac or possibly cardiac:” Preferred terms specific to the potential underlying diagnosis when a cardiac etiology is suspected
*   Stable angina
*   Prinzmetal’s angina
*   Chest pain not otherwise specified
    *   Approximately one-half of patients assessed for ACS are ultimately diagnosed as common low risk. [Lindsell CJ, Anantharaman V, Diercks D, et al. The Internet Tracking Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes (i*trACS): a multicenter registry of patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndromes reported using the standardized reporting guidelines for emergency department chest pain studies. Ann Emerg Med. 2006;48(6):666-677.e6779. doi:10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.08.005]
    *   “Atypical” is a misleading descriptor that may be misinterpreted as benign; its use is discouraged.
    *   “Noncardiac” should be used if heart disease is not suspected.

#### Pulmonary or Pleural Etiology

*   Bronchitis
*   Pneumonia

#### Gastrointestinal Etiology

*   Gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD)
*   Peptic ulcer disease

#### Other Etiologies

*   Musculoskeletal, cutaneous, vascular, psychiatric, or inflammatory disease

## Diagnostic tests

### Initial orders

#### ECG

*   Perform and interpret an ECG within 10 minutes of arrival to the emergency department for patients with chest pain or equivalent
*   Patients with evidence of obstructive myocardial infarction or ST-elevation MI (STEMI) may be candidates for revascularization with fibrinolytics or percutaneous coronary intervention.
*   A repeat ECG is indicated in patients with possible ACS after 15-30 minutes, or with any change in vital signs or clinical status (eg, a new episode of pain).
*   [Chest Pain Evaluation for ACS](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
*   The ECG in pulmonary embolism is most commonly non-specific but signs of acute right sided heart strain may point toward the diagnosis.
    *   [Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
*   ECGs in aortic dissection are often normal or non-specific.
    *   Note: Rarely, an acute MI seen on ECG may represent a Type A aortic dissection that occludes the coronary arteries.
    *   [Aortic Dissection](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
*   Low voltage and electrical alternans are characteristic of pericardial tamponade.

#### Cardiac markers

*   Obtain troponin levels in patients with presentations consistent with ACS or concern for myocarditis.
    *   [Chest Pain Evaluation for ACS](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
*   Consider ordering troponin for risk stratification in pulmonary embolism.
*   B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP or NT-proBNP) may be significantly elevated in cases of heart failure and pulmonary embolism.
    *   [Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)

#### D-dimer

*   Consider D-dimer levels in patients who are risk-stratified as low to moderate risk for pulmonary embolism.
*   A negative D-dimer in combination with low pretest probability identifies patients who are not likely to benefit from imaging for acute aortic dissection.
*   Use age and sex specific adjustments to D-dimer cutoffs. Consider pregnancy adjusted D-dimer.
    *   [Venous Thromboembolism](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)

#### Consider point-of-care ultrasound

*   Regional wall motion abnormalities suggest ACS or previous infarct. Mechanical complications of ACS such as valvular insufficiency, septal, or free wall rupture may also be identified.
*   Signs of right heart strain may be seen in pulmonary embolism.
*   Pericardial effusion is readily identified on ultrasound and may be a complication of pericarditis, thoracic aortic dissection, or free wall rupture post-MI.
*   Cardiac tamponade is manifested by diastolic collapse of the cardiac chambers (usually right ventricular and right atrium) in the setting of a significant effusion.
*   Patients in shock with significant pericardial effusion on point-of-care should be treated clinically as tamponade.
*   Pneumothorax may be identified by ultrasound in cases of tension pneumothorax.
*   B-lines may be seen in acute decompensated heart failure.
*   Aortic stenosis may present with angina. This represents a serious inflection point in disease progression requiring surgical consultation.
*   Signs of aortic dissection may also be seen on transthoracic ultrasound, but its sensitivity is lower than with transesophageal echocardiogram, which is 98% sensitive for dissection.
*   Gastrointestinal causes of chest pain, such as acute cholecystitis may be identified.

#### Chest X-ray

*   The chest X-ray in pulmonary embolism is often non-specific (eg, signs of atelectasis), but more specific signs such as Hampton hump and Westermark sign can be seen.
*   Findings in aortic dissection include widened mediastinum (61%) or abnormal aortic contour (50%), at least 1 of these 2 findings (79%), or normal (12%).
*   Findings in esophageal rupture include pneumomediastinum and left-sided pleural effusion. The diagnosis can often be suspected on plain films but often requires CT for definitive diagnosis.
*   Tension pneumothorax is usually a clinical diagnosis (involving both hypoxia and shock) that should be treated immediately before imaging, signs of tension (eg, severe mediastinal shifting, bowing of the diaphragm) may be seen on chest X-ray if decompression does not occur.

### Advanced imaging

### PEARLS

*   Computed tomography (CT) is indicated in the ED evaluation of chest pain in select subset cases.
*   CT can provide diagnostic information for all critical diagnoses, but should not delay life-saving resuscitation (eg, advanced airway management) and interventions (eg, transport to the cardiac catheterization suite or operating room).
*   CT with oral contrast is recommended for definitive diagnosis of esophageal rupture. However, a recent single site study did not show a decrease in sensitivity without oral contrast.
*   CT angiography (CTA) is the study of choice for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection.
*   CTA or transesophageal echocardiography (in unstable patients) can be used to detect acute aortic dissection and examine whether dissection involves the ascending aorta.
*   Triple rule-out CTA protocols for ACS, pulmonary embolism, and acute aortic dissection are available at some institutions for select patients, although the sensitivity of these triple rule-out protocols is lower.

## Treatment

### All patients

*   Address airway, breathing, and circulation.
*   Start an intravenous line, oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) >92%, and start cardiac monitoring.
*   Administer aspirin in most patients with chest pain.
    *   Aspirin 162-325 mg orally chewed. Aspirin should be a chewable formulation. Use 600 mg rectally if oral route is not feasible. If the patient is unable to tolerate aspirin, clopidogrel 75 mg by mouth is an alternative.
*   Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q5 minutes × 3 as needed for chest pain; add intravenous nitroglycerin for persistent systems. Hold for hypotension or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Be cautious for hypotension in inferior MI.
*   See chapter: [Acute Coronary Syndromes](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)

### Other specific treatments

*   Pulmonary embolism is treated with anticoagulation or fibrinolysis.
*   Aortic dissection requires heart rate and blood pressure control and surgical consultation.
*   Esophageal rupture is treated with intravenous antibiotics, nothing-by-mouth status, proton pump inhibitors followed by surgery.
*   Tension pneumothorax is treated with finger decompression while preparing for ED thoracostomy.
*   Pericardial tamponade requires pericardiocentesis. If the patient is too hemodynamically unstable to be transferred for catheter pericardiocentesis in the catheterization lab, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis should be performed in the ED.

## Deep Dive

### Background

#### Terminology

*   This chapter uses the term “chest pain”. Clinically, this term is expansive and should include chest pain equivalents. These include but are not limited to:
    #### Pain descriptions
    *   Pressure
    *   Tightness
    *   Discomfort
    #### Locations
    *   Shoulders
    *   Arms
    *   Back
    *   Upper abdomen/epigastric
    *   Mandible
    #### Other ACS equivalents
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Fatigue

#### Epidemiology

*   Of all patients presenting to the emergency department with a primary complaint of chest pain
    *   ~5-12% of ED patients with chest pain have ACS.
    *   5 cases/million population/year have aortic dissection. Most cases present with chest pain.
    *   Pulmonary Embolism has an incidence of ~0.5% in ED presenting with chest pain.
    *   About 50% of patients who present to the ED with chest pain have a diagnosis of chest pain not otherwise specified.

#### Pathophysiology

*   The chest and epigastric regions contain many important structures; thus, the differential diagnosis of chest pain is wide. Conversely, patients with the classical chest pain diagnoses, including ACS, pulmonary embolism, and acute aortic dissection, may not present with chest pain at all.
*   Pathology of various structures, including the gastrointestinal tract, heart with great vessels, lungs, skin, and liver, can all cause chest pain. Some diagnoses are life-threatening (i.e.~20% with acute aortic dissection die before admission to the hospital), while other diagnoses are so benign that the ED does not routinely test for them (eg, GERD/peptic ulcer disease).

### Diagnostic Considerations

#### Initial approach

*   There are 2 parallel tracks for the first few minutes of care in the chest pain patient: Clinicians begin an assessment and treatment, while the patient is simultaneously placed on tele monitoring and an initial ECG is obtained.
*   While non-classic symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and radiation of discomfort, or numbness may be present, chest pain or discomfort remains the predominant symptom reported in both men and women diagnosed with myocardial ischemia.

### PEARLS

*   The history of a patient with chest pain may not be “classic,” but remains important for diagnosis and risk stratification.

#### History of the present illness

*   Onset
    *   Determining what the patient was doing at the onset of symptoms helps with the diagnosis.
    *   It is important to question whether the patient was using recreational drugs. Cocaine and amphetamines are associated with ACS, aortic dissection, acute Prinzmetal’s angina, and (if inhaled) pneumothorax.
    *   Knowing when the pain started is important in determining whether the suspected injury is in a time range that can be detected by the troponin assay.
    *   The time since the onset of pain also helps to guide treatment in STEMI.
*   Palliative/provocative factors: Provocation upon breathing may point to a pulmonary etiology. Exacerbation by exertion may point to ischemia. Relief of symptoms with nitroglycerin is not a reliable test to rule out cardiac ischemia.
*   Quality: A ripping sensation is classically associated with acute aortic dissection. Heaviness or squeezing is associated with ACS.
*   Region or radiation: Jaw or arm is classically associated with ACS. Radiation to the upper back is often associated with acute aortic dissection. Radiation from the epigastrium to the mid-back is often associated with biliary disease.
*   Risk Factors
*   Severity: Ask patients to rate their pain on a scale from 1-10. The severity of the pain is not diagnostic, but it allows the clinician to have a goal for symptom reduction.
*   Timing: Stable angina often lasts 2-3 minutes in contrast to ACS, which classically lasts >20 minutes. It is useful to know whether the pain has been constant or intermittent.

#### Associated symptoms

*   ACS is classically associated with nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and diaphoresis.
*   Pulmonary embolism is classically associated with unilateral extremity swelling/pain and dyspnea. Pulmonary embolism presenting with syncope is prognostic for increased mortality, since it is related to hemodynamic instability and right ventricular dysfunction.
*   Congestive heart failure, COPD, and pneumothorax are associated with shortness of breath.
*   Heart failure may also be associated with palpitations.
*   The clinician should ascertain Risk Factors for the various critical diagnoses.
*   Framingham risk factors do not help to determine whether a given patient is having an ACS event.
*   In diagnosing ACS, studies show limited clinical value of the classical Framingham cardiac risk factors (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and family history of CAD), since these factors were designed to assess the long-term risk of CAD. Instead, more weight should be given to the clinical presentation.
*   Framingham risk factors do help to determine the risk of adverse events once the diagnosis of ACS has been established.
*   Classic risk factors are an important part of the most commonly used accelerated diagnostic protocols and risk stratification tools (e.g., the TIMI score, the HEART score, etc.) for acute coronary syndrome.
*   Obtain a history of previous risk stratification procedures, including stress tests, catheterizations, surgeries/procedures, and imaging.

### PEARLS

*   History and physical alone are not sufficient to rule in or out ACS. Further diagnostic work-up is often necessary.

#### Diagnostic testing

#### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

### PEARLS

*   ECG is the most basic diagnostic and prognostic tool for the evaluation of chest pain.
*   A physician should review the first ECG within 10 minutes of presentation to an ED. The initial ECG is often non-diagnostic. One study showed that 20% of patients eventually diagnosed with AMI had initially presented to the ED with a normal ECG.
*   If clinical suspicion of ACS remains, repeat the ECG every 15-30 minutes for the first hour and again following any change in patient status.
*   Repeat ECG with each troponin.

##### Suspected ACS

*   An ST elevation pattern warrants a much more aggressive treatment pathway, including revascularization. For further discussion, see reperfusion strategies in [Acute Coronary Syndromes](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient).
*   In the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy or left bundle branch block, ST elevation is defined as follows:
    *   ≥1 mm ST elevation in at least 2 contiguous leads except for V2-V3. If V2-V3, ST elevation must be ≥2 mm in men ≥40 years old, ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years old, or ≥1.5 mm in women.
*   Some ECG findings should be treated similarly to ST elevation due to the increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.
    *   Posterior infarct with >2 mm ST depression anteriorly in V1-V4. This is often seen with an R/S ratio >1.
    *   Isolated ST elevation in aVR with upsloping ST depression in precordial leads (“DeWinter T-waves”) is associated with proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion; consider aggressive treatment, including revascularization. [STEMI aVR with proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
*   Left bundle branch block may interfere with analysis for ST elevation. Even a new left bundle branch block per se does not necessarily indicate a STEMI, but if the patient is acutely ill, consider aggressive treatment including revascularization. Use Sgarbossa or modified Sgarbossa criteria to help determine whether the left bundle branch block is likely a STEMI equivalent (transmural infarct) requiring revascularization.
*   Right ventricular MI coincides with 30%-50% of inferior wall infarctions. Obtain right-sided leads for all inferior MIs as long as it does not delay reperfusion therapy. If right ventricular involvement is confirmed, avoid nitrates and administer intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure, as long as the lungs remain clear to auscultation.

### PITFALLS

*   ECG can help detect MI, but may be normal or non-specific in unstable angina. Thus, a normal ECG does not rule out a medical emergency or eliminate the need for further work-up if clinical suspicion of ACS remains.

##### Suspected pulmonary embolism

*   Most ECGs (70%) are abnormal in pulmonary embolism patients.
*   Classic S1Q3T3 is neither sensitive nor specific, but may be predictive of shock when combined with other more common signs of right ventricular strain, including tachycardia (38%), T-wave inversion in anterior leads (38%), and ST elevation in aVR (36%).

##### Suspected acute aortic dissection

*   ST elevation with acute aortic dissection is an ominous sign, associated with extension of a Stanford type A dissection into the coronary arteries. Emergency point-of-care ultrasound is recommended to assess for associated pericardial tamponade or valve injury.

#### Chest X-ray (CXR)

### PEARLS

*   CXR is useful in determining the etiology of chest pain in the ED.
*   In ACS, CXR is often normal or non-specific, unless the patient is in acute decompensated heart failure. Vascular congestion or pulmonary edema increases the likelihood ratio (LR) of heart failure to +LR = 12.
*   In pulmonary embolism, CXR is often non-specific.
*   In acute aortic dissection, one study showed that CXR has a 67% sensitivity and 70% specificity. Thus, plain radiography alone cannot rule out moderate- to high-risk patients.
    *   The most common abnormality was a widened aortic arch, at about 70%, but its presence gave only a moderate increase in the likelihood of the disease (+LR = 3.2 and −LR = 0.4).
    *   A widened mediastinum occurred ~60% of the time, but had lower predictive LRs (+LR = 2.2 and −LR = 0.6).
    *   The most powerful predictor of acute aortic dissection is aortic kinking (+LR = 10.2), but kinking occurred in fewer than one-half of the patients in the study. Tracheal displacement and rib notching are rare.
    *   An ominous finding would be apical capping or pleural effusion, since these may be indicative of aortic rupture.
*   Esophageal rupture or mediastinitis may be seen on conventional CXR:
    *   Mediastinal air
    *   Subcutaneous air
    *   Wide mediastinum
    *   Soilage of the pleural cavity with gastric contents. This appears as a pleural effusion
*   When there is sufficient clinical concern or an abnormal CXR that suggests esophageal rupture or mediastinitis, CT should be performed.
*   Radiography detects pneumothorax by a lack of lung markings in the least dependent part of the chest. Thus, if considering pneumothorax, obtain an upright radiograph to detect pneumothorax in the apex and periphery.
    *   In a supine image, air can collect as lucency along the mediastinum, or it may show in the inferior sulci, causing a “deep sulcus” sign.
    *   Shifting of the mediastinal structures is an ominous sign of a tension pneumothorax.
*   Radiographs are less sensitive than point-of-care ultrasound or small pneumothoraces. One prospective study in ED trauma patients found a sensitivity of 75% for a single upright anteroposterior CXR vs. 98% for point-of-care ultrasound.
*   CXR is useful for detecting pneumonia.

#### Laboratory studies

##### Troponin

### PEARLS

*   Troponin is the test of choice for diagnosing MI. Along with the history and ECG, troponin plays an essential role in diagnosing MI. Elevated troponin is proportional to increased mortality in ACS.
*   The performance of modern-generation high-sensitivity cardiac troponins (hs-cTn) is superior to that of standard troponin assays, particularly in patients who present early to the ED.
    *   hs-cTn is both more sensitive and has superior negative predictive value compared to older assays.
    *   In patients who present to the ED within 3 hour of chest pain onset, the diagnostic accuracy of hs-cTn is 92%-94%, depending on the hs-cTn assay used. This is significantly better than the 76% seen for a standard assay. There are various accelerated diagnostic protocols for hs-cTn, and the European Society of Cardiology recently published corresponding guidelines.
    *   A more sensitive assay could lead to more false positives. However, a recent study from Massachusetts General Hospital showed decreased downstream testing including fewer CTs, fewer stress tests, less PCI and less outpatient treatment.
*   It is important for the clinician to be familiar with the troponin lab assay used in their local laboratory or to use a standard department protocol built around that assay. The suggested algorithm shown assumes a moderate-sensitivity troponin.
*   The decision of whether to recheck the troponin to rule out MI depends on the time since the onset of pain and the profile of the troponin assay that is used. If the time from chest pain onset to application of the initial troponin assay is longer than the time required for the assay to detect troponin, there may be no need to repeat the troponin unless the chest pain has been intermittent.
*   In pulmonary embolism, an elevated troponin is a sign of right ventricular strain and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A meta-analysis of normotensive patients found that a positive troponin was associated with a mortality odds ratio of 6.25. A positive troponin is one of the criteria for submassive pulmonary embolism.
*   An elevated troponin in acute aortic dissection may be a sign that the aortic dissection has occluded coronary arteries.

##### D-dimer

### PEARLS

*   D-dimer is an integral part of pathways to diagnose pulmonary embolism. Consider D-dimer in patients with a low to intermediate pretest probability of having a pulmonary embolism.
*   D-dimer, when used in conjunction with pretest assessment, can be age-adjusted to increase the proportion of patients in whom pulmonary embolism can be excluded on the basis of D-dimer, without additional false negatives. The age-adjusted cut-off for maximum “normal” D-dimer = Age × 10 in patients >50 years old.
*   In patients with a pretest probability <15% (by gestalt or Wells/Revised Geneva Score) with Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria = 0, pulmonary embolism can be ruled out without further diagnostic testing, including D-dimer.
*   Similarly, high-risk patients who can be defined by the Wells criteria or Revised Geneva Score should be imaged without D-dimer: D-dimer has an unacceptable false negative rate (12%-23% depending on risk) in a high pretest probability population.
*   D-dimer has 94% (95% confidence interval: 91%-96%) sensitivity in acute aortic dissection but is insufficient to rule out dissection alone. A recent prospective trial in a low-risk patient population showed that a negative Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score in combination with a D-dimer <500 ng/mL was sufficient to determine a population that did not require imaging. This study has not yet been validated.

##### Other serum test

*   A complete blood count is useful for detecting pneumonia and cholecystitis. Anemia may be the etiology of ACS or may exacerbate ACS. Mediastinitis is often associated with an elevated white blood cell count.
*   A comprehensive metabolic panel has diagnostic value for liver or biliary pathology. High lipase indicates pancreatic inflammation as a possible cause of chest pain.
*   Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time in patients who are already on or need to be started on anticoagulation.

#### Advanced imaging

##### CT

### PEARLS

*   Consider coronary CT angiography as an alternative to stress testing in moderate- or higher-risk patients for whom acute MI has been ruled out (ECG non-diagnostic, troponin negative).
*   CT can provide diagnostic information for all critical diagnoses. CT angiography is the test of choice for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection.
*   Triple rule-out protocols for ACS, pulmonary embolism, and acute aortic dissection are available for selected patients.
*   CT is useful for the diagnosis and assessment of mediastinitis and esophageal rupture. Thoracic CT with intravenous and water-soluble oral contrast, is preferred as the initial test in the ED. If there is concern for infection, CT should include soft tissue of the neck.
    *   Sensitive for infection, fluid collection, and abscesses
    *   Can identify the extent of soft tissue infiltration
    *   Can locate esophageal injury
    *   Useful in surgical planning

##### Point-of-care ultrasound

*   Useful for determining regional wall motion abnormalities in ACS, right heart strain in pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion in pericardial tamponade, pneumothorax in tension pneumothorax, and B-lines in acute decompensated heart failure. Can be used for aortic dissection, but has a lower sensitivity. The rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) exam (“Pump, Tank, and Pipes”) is a method for quick assessment of the etiology in a critically ill patient.

### Clinical decision pathways

*   See chapter: [Low Risk Chest Pain](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient) and [Accelerated Diagnostic Protocols for Possible Acute Coronary Syndrome](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
*   Routinely use a Clinical Decision Pathway to help define risk of ACS and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. This is a class 1 recommendation of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association.
*   There are a variety of clinical decision pathways including HEART, EDASC, ADAPT, NOTR, 2020 ESC and GRACE. The HEART score is well studied, easy to apply and American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policy on NSTEMI endorses the use of the HEART score.
*   Clinical decision pathways decrease unnecessary testing and reduce admissions while maintaining a high sensitivity for ACS.

#### HEART Score

*   Perform risk stratification for suspected ACS or in patients with chest pain and no alternative diagnosis. The HEART score is a well-studied tool that can be quickly applied for predicting major adverse cardiac events and is often used in accelerated ED evaluation protocols.

### PERSPECTIVES

*   We recommend admitting patients with ischemic ECGs and/or positive troponins, in addition to cardiology consultation. The diagnostic approach to chest pain diverges from the pathway suggested by Mahler: In our flow chart, patients with strongly positive troponins are not considered for outpatient treatment. Despite evidence backing Mahler’s approach, adherence to the pathway is variable.
*   The 2021 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines give a level 2a recommendation that if a patient is low risk (<1% 30 day risk of death or malignant cerebral edema), it is reasonable to discharge home without admission or urgent cardiac testing. A HEART score <3 with negative troponins is considered low risk.

#### Observation units

*   Observation or chest pain units are common and provide a middle ground between inpatient and outpatient testing. Patient selection and management are based on accelerated rule-out protocols that ideally include stress testing in selected patients. These units can decrease unnecessary admissions, reduce the rate of missed MIs, reduce costs, and increase patient satisfaction.

#### Stress tests

*   Stress testing is a diagnostic instrument currently available for the evaluation and risk stratification of patients with known or suspected CAD.
*   Who gets a stress test algorithm shows an example of the decision tree for determining which type of stress test to order.
*   At the most basic level, stress testing consists of having the patient exercise to increase myocardial oxygen demand and subsequently assessing the patient using physiologic, ECG, and possible imaging assessment to detect induced ischemia.
*   When noninvasive cardiac stress testing is to be performed, it is recommended to be completed before discharge or within 72 hours. There is some evidence to support a very small decrease in death or MI in ED patients.
*   Stress testing may be performed with concurrent ECG monitoring, nuclear scintigraphy, or echocardiography.
*   Moderate-risk patients and any patients for whom there is a need to localize ischemia or assess the viability of the myocardium benefit from imaging in conjunction with ECG testing.
*   Any patient with a baseline ECG that complicates the interpretation of an ECG stress test, including ST depression, digoxin effect, or intraventricular conduction delay (eg, left bundle branch block or paced rhythm), would also benefit from imaging.
*   Pharmacologic agents can be substituted for physical exercise to cause increased myocardial work and oxygen demand.
*   Stress testing is preferred over Coronary CT angiography in medium to high risk patients who are older or are suspected of having greater CAD.

#### Coronary CT angiography (CTA)

*   Coronary CTA is a safe and effective alternative to stress testing. Over the last decade, this technology has been increasingly used in the United States.
*   Coronary CTA can rule out objective CAD and diagnose the extent and severity of non-obstructive lesions. It is favored over stress testing for intermediate to high likelihood in younger patients; when less obstructive CAD is suspected; or when the differential diagnosis indicates imaging of other structures.
*   Calculation of fractional flow reserve with CT (FFRct) can be used to determine lesion-specific ischemia. It has long been used by cardiology to help determine if a lesion is amenable to PCI. It is a post hoc adjunct to a Coronary CTA using AI algorithms that can give physiologic information to augment a CTA’s anatomic imaging. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have reduced the processing times from 1-2 days to approximately an hour for use in emergency departments. There is limited evidence for its use in Emergency Departments. This year it was adopted into the American College of Cardiologists/American Heart Association guidelines for evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain.
*   The ROMICAT-II study shows that coronary CTA used in a chest pain pathway can decrease the hospital length of stay by over 7 hours and decrease the time to final diagnosis as compared with standard care including stress testing.
*   The use of coronary CTA as an alternative to stress testing does not increase missed major adverse cardiac events, but it does increase testing and radiation exposure. There is conflicting research data regarding cost with this approach.

### Special Populations

*   There may be differences in presentation between genders and among different ethnic backgrounds. Patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients may have little or no pain associated with ACS.
*   Women who present with chest pain are at risk of underdiagnosis of a cardiac cause.

### Pregnancy

*   See chapter: [Chest Pain in Pregnancy](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/recNgRBRR6E7Y2vJ2d/Approach-to-the-Critical-Patient)
